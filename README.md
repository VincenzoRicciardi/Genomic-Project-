# Trio-Based Variant Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

This pipeline implements a complete workflow for variant discovery and
filtering in trio-based sequencing data (child, father, mother),
focusing on chromosome 20 (GRCh38.p14 assembly).

The pipeline is written in Bash and supports processing of multiple
trios iteratively.


## Pipeline Structure

The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1.  Input Acquisition
2.  Inheritance Model Selection
3.  Alignment & Quality Control
4.  Variant Calling
5.  Variant Filtering
6.  Coverage Track Generation

## Requirements

-   Bowtie2
-   Samtools
-   Qualimap
-   FastQC
-   MultiQC
-   FreeBayes
-   BCFtools
-   Bedtools
-   bgzip (HTSlib)

## Input Data

### Required Reference Files

-   `chr20*` (Bowtie2 index)
-   `chr20.fa` (reference genome)
-   `chr20_bed` (target regions)
-   `samples.txt` (sample list): file containing the sequence of samples
    in each trio (child, father, mother)


### Raw Sequencing Data

Paired-end FASTQ files: \*\_R1.fq.gz \*\_R2.fq.gz

## Configuration before running the pipeline 

Before running the pipeline, you must update file paths to match your
system. This workflow uses absolute paths (e.g.`/home/BCG2026_exam/...`) that are specific to the original server
environment and will not work on other machines without modification. \

## Required modifications

1.  **Download chromosome 20 reference** You must explicitly download
    the reference genome (chr20) before building the index.

2.  **Build Bowtie2 index for chr20** The index must be created locally
    after downloading the reference genome.

3.  **Adapt BED file** The BED file containing target regions for exome
    sequencing must be adapted according to your experimental design and
    sequencing targets.

4.  **Update sample paths** Replace the original sample directory with
    the correct path where your FASTQ files are stored.

## Execution

In order to un the pipeline: change the mode of the pipeline after
upploaded the script chmod +x nameofthepipeline.sh run the pipeline from
your terminal ./ nameofthepipeline.sh

The pipeline will prompt for: -Case names (multiple trios separated by
spaces) -Sample IDs (corresponding to child, father, mother) -Username
(used to locate input data)

## Output Files

For each case:

-   child.bam, father.bam, mother.bam
-   BAM index files (.bai)
-   QC reports (Qualimap, FastQC, MultiQC)
-   Raw VCF (.vcf.gz)
-   Filtered VCF (.cand.vcf)
-   Coverage tracks (\*.bg)

## Notes

-   The pipeline is restricted to chromosome 20
-   Sample order must be: child father mother
-   The same sample IDs are reused across cases
-   Ensure correct file permissions and paths
